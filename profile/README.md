## What is Reaper?

**Reaper** is an advanced, highly optimized software solution designed to transform traditional fullscreen or windowed PC games into a seamless **borderless windowed mode** experience. Unlike conventional fullscreen modes that often cause significant delays, screen flickering, and application interruptions when switching between tasks, Reaper's sophisticated borderless mode ensures instantaneous and flawless alt-tab functionality. This allows for effortless multitasking without any noticeable performance degradation or game minimization.

Gamers utilizing Reaper can expect a superior computing environment where their game runs in a stable, persistent window that behaves like a fullscreen application but with the flexibility of a window. This is particularly beneficial for modern gaming setups that involve multiple monitors, streaming software, and real-time communication apps. Reaper provides unparalleled compatibility with a vast library of PC games, including demanding titles like **Minecraft**, **Metro Exodus**, **Cyberpunk 2077**, and **Elden Ring**, making it an indispensable tool for anyone serious about their PC gaming experience.

The software intelligently manages window handles and display settings, forcing games into a non-exclusive fullscreen state that bypasses common DirectX and OpenGL issues. Its open-source foundation, hosted on GitHub, guarantees transparency and continuous community-driven improvements. Reaper is the definitive choice for competitive gamers, content creators, and multitaskers who demand reliability and performance from their borderless gaming utility.
